# DRV-Project - Frontend

This directory contains the web application (frontend) for the DRV project. It is based on Vue.js 3 with Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

### Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Plugins

[Vue Language Features (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

[TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)

## Project Setup

### Install required dependencies

* Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder ```DRV_project/frontend```.
* Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

*If the dependency installation was successful, proceed with the next steps.*

### Run the application locally

* If you still have the same terminal open, you can continue. Otherwise, open a new terminal and navigate to the project folder ```DRV_project/frontend```.
* Run the following command to start the development server and to run the application locally:

```sh
npm run dev
```

* If the app compiles without any issues, you should be able to access it in your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

  * *Your port number will be different if that port is already in use by a different application.*

* Vue.js supports Hot Reload and will update the application immediately after a change was save.

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

* If you want to build the application for production, open the project folder ```DRV_project/frontend``` in a terminal and execute the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```
