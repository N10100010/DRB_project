This repository contains the front-end application of the rowing analysis tool developed in 
partnership with the German Rowing Association (DRV). The application is designed to facilitate the retrieval 
and statistical analysis of competition results from [world rowing](https://worldrowing.com/). It also provides detailed 
insights into race analysis and statistics on athlete and team performance, enabling coaches and athletes to 
make more informed decisions and improve their performance.
